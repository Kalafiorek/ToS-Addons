Original Marktioneer
--
```
Let you scan the whole market (or your current inventory) at once, displaying the lowest 3 prices on the item tooltip. This addon, of course, requires you to be right next to the market npc, with the market window open.
```

Changes in MarktioneerEX
--
- Fixed and changed the looks of "**My Items**" tab. Definetly not pink and fluffy enough, but I promise to improve.
- Made compatible with "**Market Show Level**" addon - you can still scan the market after changing characters/maps.
- You can now successfully post an item that couldn't be undercut. It simply enters the minimum possible price.
- Changed scanning log in chat to print start/finish and every 10'th percent. It also makes a sound on 100%. Capitalism, ho!


	■ WARNING ■ This addon might be incompatible with some others that change how market and it's UI works.
